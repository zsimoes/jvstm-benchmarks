 *
 *   Great care must be taken when modifying the runWithContinuationSupport code, as memory leaks can
 *   very easily be created by having captured continuations refer to previously resumed continuations.
 *
 *   The old JVM with the original continuation.patch is referred to as vm2011. The new, enhanced one
