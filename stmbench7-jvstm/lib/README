The jvstm.jar goes here.  When running the benchmarks script top-level script
the JVSTM to test will automatically be copied to this directory with the name
'jvstm.jar'.

Also, don't forget to add here the 'deuceAgent.jar' file. See the README file
at the root directory for more information about the deuce jar.
