/* algorithm description:
 * phase 1: classify each node into a type: 1, 2, 3 or 4.
 * phase 2: for nodes of type 3, propagate backwards the "must instrument" property, to all predecessors.
 * so nodes of type 4 become 3 and nodes of type 2 become 1. 
 * stop propagating at nodes of type 1. if graph's head is of type 3 or 1, stop right 
 * there - no optimization is possible.
 * phase 3: do a forward dataflow analysis. if the current scc must be instrumented:
 * if scc was a, designate it as ii, and flow b.
 * if scc was b, flow b.
 * if scc was c, designate it as i, and flow b.
 * the merge rule is: x&x=x. x&c=c. a&b=c.
 * phase 4: for all nodes designated as i and ii, add the proper initialization before them.
